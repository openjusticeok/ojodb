# Intro: The OJO database

Many of our projects and requests involve pulling court data from our OJO database. There are a few other organizations and authorities who have collected this type of data in Oklahoma, but we're somewhat unique in the amount of data we have and the tools we've developed to pull and analyze it.

Our court data comes from two sources:

-   The [Oklahoma State Court Network website](https://www.oscn.net/v4/), the official record for the most populous and organized counties in the state, and

<!-- -->

-   The [On Demand Court Records website](https://www1.odcr.com/), an alternate official record used by the less populous states.

We scrape the data posted on these websites each day, and store the contents in our database.

Having the data scraped and wrangled like this lets us answer questions that are harder to get a handle on otherwise. For example, legislators and stakeholders will often want to know things like "How many felonies were filed from 2018-2022?", or "How did eviction filings change during COVID, or as a result of X policy change?" It can be shockingly hard to answer even basic questions like that, even for government officials, and that's where our database comes in!

To get an idea of how to use the database to answer these kinds of questions, this vignette will walk through all the steps for a hypothetical research question.

### Research Question:

> How many misdemeanor cases involving drugs were filed in Oklahoma county in each month from 2016-2022?

### Before you proceed:

This vignette assumes that A) you've already installed `{ojodb}`, and B) your credentials and access to the database are properly configured -- most of the `{ojodb}` functions won't work if not. For more information on how to get everything set up, see `vignette("vignette-connecting-to-ojo")`. It can be a bit tricky to get working, so please ask for help if you have any issues!

# Step 1: Getting the lay of the land

Just for educational purposes, we'll start by taking a look around database and seeing exactly where the court data lives.

Our database is divided into a few "schemas" -- if our database is a big filing cabinet, we can imagine the schemas as separate drawers. You can see all of them using the `ojo_list_schemas()` function.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(ojodb)
library(dplyr)

ojo_list_schemas()

```

Each schema, generally speaking, relates to one of our data types / topics / policy areas. Each one contains tables that store data related to that policy area. Among others, we have:

*   a schema for `ocdc` (Oklahoma County Detention Center, i.e. the jail in Oklahoma City), 

*   another one for `odoc` (Oklahoma Department of Corrections, i.e. Oklahoma state prisons), 

*   another for `eviction_addresses` (this one contains data related to a specific eviction-related project)

The court data that we're interested in right now is stored in the default schema, `public`. Let's open the "drawer" and see what kind of data is inside.

```{r}
ojo_list_tables(schema = "public")

```

If a schema is a drawer in our filing cabinet, then tables are the folders inside. The `public` schema contains several different tables, all of which relate back to our court data. Here are the most important ones to know:

-   The `case` table contains the basic information about each case. This includes variables like the case number, the date it was filed, the judge it was assigned to, etc. It also includes ID columns that allow you to join it with the other tables in this schema in order to see things like the defendant's name and DOB, attorneys involved, etc. Each row is one **case**.

-   The `count` table contains the individual charges filed in each case; most cases involve more than one. Each row is one **charge**.

-   The `minute` table contains the court minutes for each case. This is where we get data about court fines and fees, among many other things. There are a ton of minutes per case, so working with the minute data often means having to spend a lot of time waiting for data to download. Each row is one **court minute**.

We can see exactly which variables are included in each table using the `ojo_list_vars()` function. For example, let's take a closer look at the main `case` table:

```{r}
ojo_list_vars(schema = "public", table = "case")

```

### One more important note!

You'll notice that the `case` table includes most of the things you'd expect -- the filing district, year, case type, etc. However, you might be wondering why there are also columns for things like `minutes` and `issues` -- as we just saw, this information is actually stored in a separate table within the `public` schema. The answer is that these columns aren't storing the data in and of themselves; instead, they contain keys that we can use to join the `case` table with the others.

For example, let's take a look at what these columns look like in the first five rows of the `case` table, using the `ojo_tbl()` function:

```{r}
first_five <- ojo_tbl(schema = "public", table = "case") |>
  head() |>
  collect() |>
  select(id, minutes, counts)

first_five$id

first_five$counts

first_five$minutes

```

As you can see, these columns look a bit different, and don't store any data themselves. Instead, they contain *array* variables that we can use to join the `case` table to the `counts` and `minutes` tables as needed. Joining tables will be discussed more later, and our helper functions mean that we shouldn't have to think about this stuff outside of unusual circumstances.

To be clear, it's not crucial that you become an expert on database systems or anything like that. It is only mentioned here because it can be pretty confusing if you're new to databases.

# Step 2: Pulling case data

Now that we understand the basic layout of the database, we can start pulling the data we're interested in! Fortunately, we have helper functions that save us from having to think too much about schemas and tables in our daily work. 

Keeping our research question in mind, we'll start by pulling all the **misdemeanor criminal cases** filed in **Oklahoma county** from **2018-2022**. We'll use one of our helper functions, `ojo_crim_cases()`, to do so. Note that there's also `ojo_civ_cases()` for when we want to look at civil court data.

```{r}
case_data <- ojo_crim_cases(districts = "OKLAHOMA",
                            case_types = "CM", # "CM" is short for "Criminal Misdemeanor"
                            file_years = 2018:2022) |>
  collect()

nrow(case_data)

```

The `collect()` function we're using is from the `{dplyr}` package. Our helper function `ojo_crim_cases()` uses the provided arguments to put together a query to our database, and the `collect()` function executes that query and returns the result as a lazy tibble into your R environment. If we wanted to, we could add in additional filtering, sorting, etc. by adding `{dplyr}` functions like `filter()`, `select()`, etc. before the `collect()` call. But for now, we want to see everything.

Now we've got our case data saved as the object `case_data`, nice! It looks like it includes `r nrow(case_data) |> format(big.mark = ",")` rows / cases.

# Step 3: Wrangling and cleaning the data

# Step 4: Analyzing and graphing the data
